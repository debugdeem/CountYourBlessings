# CountYourBlessings

This is an engineering product by @debugdeem.

Background: Muslims are required to pray 5 times a day. The prayer is made up of units called rakats. Each rakat includes 1 ruku (bowing) and 2 sajdas/sujoods (prostration). A sajda is when the forehead touches the prayer mat. The five daily prayers have different rakats for each time of day.

- Fajr (morning prayer): 2 rakat
- Zuhr (early afternoon prayer): 4 rakat
- Asr (late afternoon prayer): 4 rakat
- Maghrib (sunset prayer): 3 rakat
- Isha (evening prayer): 4 rakat

Problem: Prayer involves focus, however focus can get lost at times. "Kids, school, work, family, oh gotta do my taxes." It can become easy to forget how many rakats have been completed.

Solution: This project counts the number of rakats based on the sajdas. 2 sajdas = 2 forehead touches to the prayer mat = 1 rakat. The count is then displayed on your phone.

Notes: The device connects to the local wifi. A user can then connect to the device's localhost which has been designed in html to display the rakat count in big bold letters. User can also reset the count from their phone or by triple tapping the sensor in the prayer mat.
